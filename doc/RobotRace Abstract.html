				This program is an implementation of the Wizards of the Coast board game RoboRally. The goal of the game is to navigate the dangerous factory floor in order to tag the two flags, and the first player to accomplish this is the winner.
				<br>
				<br>
				Players face obstacles on the board - in the form of conveyor belts, pits and rotators - and in the other players, both by being shot at and by being pushed off course. Players must plan carefully, as they are allowed only limited movement options each turn, and these become even more restricted as the robots take damage.
				<br>
				<br>
				Robot Race was written in Java using the NetBeans IDE. It imports .jpg and .png files for use as graphical elements, and reads a text file for board configuration.
